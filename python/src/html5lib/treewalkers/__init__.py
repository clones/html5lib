"""A collection of modules for iterating through different kinds of
tree, generating tokens identical to those produced by the tokenizer
module.

To create a tree walker for a new type of tree, you need to do
implement a tree walker object (called TreeWalker by convention) that
implements a 'serialize' method taking a tree as sole argument and
returning an iterator generating tokens.
