The testcases require the use of simplejson
(http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/simplejson). Each testcase file can
be run directly through a python interpreter (e.g. python
test_tokenizer.py). However the tests are designed to work with the
nose unit-test framework (http://nose.python-hosting.com). If nose is
installed the command nosetests will run all avaliable unit tests.
