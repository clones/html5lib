html5lib is a pure-python library for parsing HTML. It is designed to
conform to the Web Applications 1.0 specification, which has
formalized the error handling algorithms of popular web browsers.

 = Installation =

html5lib is packaged with distutils. To install it use:
 $ python setup.py install

 = Tests =

You may wish to check that your installation has been a success by
running the testsuite. All the tests can be run by invoking
runtests.py in the tests/ directory

 = Usage =

Simple usage follows this pattern:

import html5lib

f = open("mydocument.html")

parser = html5lib.HTMLParser()
document = parser.parse(f)

The returned document is a simple DOM-like structure which can be
navigated using the .parent and .childNode attributes on each
element. Future releases will support a more substantial tree
implementation. 

More documentation is avaliable in the docstrings.
