This implementation doesn't work yet. Bits and pieces are getting written
at a time.

This is an implementation of the HTML5 specification for PHP. More friendly
details forthcoming, but here are some notes:

* To setup unit tests, you need to add a small stub file test-settings.php
  that contains $simpletest_location = 'path/to/simpletest/';

* We don't want to ultimately use PHP's DOM because it is not tolerant
  of certain types of errors that HTML 5 allows (for example, an element
  "foo@bar"). But for now, we will, since it's much easier.
